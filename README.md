This is a collection of tests and exercises that I've 
written in trying to learn C++. Most of it was written
a decade ago and doesn't currently work. At least not 
in OS X Lion.

Since I want to get back to learning C++ again I've uploaded 
this here. I'll get around to fixing any issues in my old
code eventually.
